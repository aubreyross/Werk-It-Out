# Werk-It-Out
2022 is here and what better way to start of the year than working on your fitness goals and feeling your best! This easy to use workout tracker will help you stay on top of your goals and reflect on your progress along the way.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
